          Telecom service was introduced in Ethiopia by Emperor Menelik II in 1894 during the commencement of the telephone line installation from Harar to Addis Ababa. Then the inter-urban network was expanded in all other directions from the capital and many important centers in the Empire were interconnected by landlines to facilitate long-distance communications with the help of intermediate operators acting as verbal human repeaters.

          As a continuation of the 2005/06-2009/10 five-year plan and after concentrating its efforts on education, health and agriculture, the Ethiopian government decided to focus on the improvement of telecommunication services considering them as key lever in the development of Ethiopia. Ethio telecom was born on 29 November 2010, from this ambition of supporting the steady growth of our country.
